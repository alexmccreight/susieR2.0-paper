# Main Figures

Each notebook is fully executable and documented to ensure reproducibility of our results. The main sections include:

- **Figure 2**: Performance comparison of ColocBoost with other multi-trait colocalization methods in simulation benchmarks
- **Figure 3**: ColocBoost xQTL analysis across cell types and traits modalities
- **Figure 4**: Validation of ColocBoost colocalization signals using CRISPR data
- **Figure 5**: Disease heritability analyses of variant-level functional annotations derived from ColocBoost
- **Figure 6**: ADâ€“xQTL ColocBoost identifies colocalized variants between xQTLs and AD GWAS
