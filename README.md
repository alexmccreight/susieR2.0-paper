Code and data to reproduce figures in susieR 2.0 manuscript.


## About susieR 2.0

susieR 2.0 is a complete architectural redesign that addresses code duplication and fragmented architecture of the original SuSiE implementation while adding new features including unmappable effects modeling and variuos performance optimizations, all while maintaing full backward compatibility.

susieR 2.0 eliminates this duplicative architecture through a unified framework built on modular design principles. The user-facing interface remains unchanged, but the implementation now uses generic functions with data-type specific backends through Râ€™s S3 dispatch system. This architecture enables the integration of new SuSiE extensions while maintaining identical results to their original versions. Beyond architectural improvements, this release introduces substantial algorithmic advances including support for unmappable effects modeling, enhanced computational speed for regularized LD matrices, new convergence criteria, and improved refinement procedures.
